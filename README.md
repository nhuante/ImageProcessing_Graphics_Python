# ImageProcessing_Graphics_Python
This repo showcases two graphics projects built in Python using PyGame and OpenGL. Project 1 explores image processing through custom convolution filters (grayscale, invert, blur, edge detection). Project 2 demonstrates 3D graphics transformations with a fully animated and controllable character using OpenGL.

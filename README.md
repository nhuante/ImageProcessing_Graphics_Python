# Image Processing & Graphics Projects in Python

Welcome! This repository contains two graphics projects developed using Python for a computer graphics course. Project 1 focuses on 2D image filters using convolution, and Project 2 builds and animates a 3D scarecrow character using OpenGL.

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Filters
**Goal** - Implementations of several image filters and convolution techniques using NumPy and PyGame. 
Includes:
- Grayscale conversion (luma, average, lightness)
- Color inversion
- Brightness adjustment with overflow handling
- Shift filters using 2D convolution
- Sobel edge detection
- Triangle and Gaussian blur with 1D convolution

### Project 2: Transformation & Viewing
**Goal** - 3D animation project using OpenGL and PyGame to build, animate, and control a scarecrow model. 
Includes:
- Scene graph hierarchy for transformations
- Walk-in-place and freeform walking animation
- Interactive camera views (front, side, back, first-person)
- Dynamic camera tilt and zoom
- Keyboard-controlled movement and animation speed
